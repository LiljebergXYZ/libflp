# libflp
Library for parsing [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/) `.flp` files in C++.

Still in development.

## Why?
I have a folder full of numbered projects. I have no idea what's in what, so being able to automate
sorting and information gathering is a great thing.

## Support
Support for all FLP events is limited. Not all events are known, and not all events are strictly
necessary to implement at this moment.
